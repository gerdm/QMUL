    "1. The behvaiour of the GME stock in terms of the participants: the nodes are the market participants and the edges are nodes representing whether two nodes (market participants) have made a transaction. The importance of modeling this network is to know whether a \"short-ladder\" attack is actually begin done on GME. Some people on the internet especulate that hedge funds are trying to syntetically drive the price of the GME to $0. If this is true, then we should see small \"clusters\" that make big and frequent transactions among them, and another big cluster of nodes that remain mostly static or buy GME shares, but do not sell them. The small clusters would represent the hedge funds (small with big purchasing power), and the big cluster the \"retail\" investors.\n",

    "2. In the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, the author argues that cultures are not static but are in constant motion. We could model cultures as a complex system via a weighted directed graph. Each node represents a culture and every edge is a weighted value of the impact of a culture in another. Modeling cultures as a complex system can makes us model how a culture \"is born\" or when they cease to exist.\n",
