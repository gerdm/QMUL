\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item What is the main message of the paper? \\ \textbf{Ans}: One can make use of analytical tools to study which nodes guide the dynamics (behaviour) of an arbitrary complex directed networks. This requires to know where in a complex network should one place \textit{input} nodes to drive the state of the network to a different configuration. 
	\item Why is the paper relevant? \\ \textbf{Ans}: They were able to show that the minimum number of nodes that control the dynamics of a complex network is given by the degree distribution, i.e., the probability distribution of how many connections a given node contains.

They find, for instance, that in social networks, few individuals may be able to control the system.\\Then, they make use of the minimum number of nodes to show the role that plays the \textit{density} of the of the network.\\Finally, they analyze how robust the controllability of a network is in terms of the mean degree of each network.

\subsection*{A critical review of the ``Controllability of Complex Networks'' paper}

In the paper, The Controllability of Complex Networks, the authors show that by choosing and manipulating only a number of input nodes --which are determined by the architecture of the network-- one can drive the state of the system. More specifically, they show that the degree distribution of the network determines the minimum number of \textit{input} nodes that a network should have in order to control the state of the system.

What makes the the Controllability of complex networks a good paper is the insight, discovery, and pedagogy that the authors used to convey their message. They are able to show how a conceptually-simple rule is enough to check the controllability of a network, namely, that whether the rank of the matrix $C = (B, AB, A^2B, \ldots, A^{N-1}B)$  has full rank is enough to determine whether the system is controllable; they discover that the nodes that tend to drive the system tends to avoid nodes that are highly connected to other nodes; finally, their exposition of the mathematical and experimental result gives the reader a sense that their results are not only mathematically appealing, but that they have a ``real-world"" application.

Their well-written abstract and lengthy introduction gives the reader enough time to understand what their goals were and what they found. One particular aspect of the paper which I really liked was their their approach to focus the paper on their findings and results which make the reading relatively easy to follow and understand the main ideas without the use of too much math, while at the same time providing a section on supplementary information to understand the math behind their ideas.


\section*{Section C: Communicating Mathematics}

\subsection*{Understanding $(a_n)_n \prec (b_n)_n$}
The role of the symbol $<$ on the real line is to denote order. Informally speaking, for any two numbers $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $a < b$ means that $a$ is to left of $b$ (see figure \ref{fig:real-line}). Therefore, to check whether $a < b$, we just need to verify whether $a$ is to the left of $b$.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\input{figures/real-line.tikz}
	\caption{Numbers on the real line. In this example, we see that $a < b$ since $a$ is to the left of $b$.}
	\label{fig:real-line}
\end{figure*}

However, as we start working with more abstract mathematical objects, it becomes harder to define a notion of order based on spacial position. Suppose that we are given two series of positive real numbers $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, and we decide to assign some order to them. Clearly, we cannot make use of $<$ to compare which series has higher-order. Not only is $<$ defined to work on the real line, but there is no clear way on how to compare two series based on positioning.

In order to compare the two series, we need to come up with a definition of order that \textit{makes sense}. One such way is to define order in terms of \textit{growth}. That is, a series $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ has a higher rank than $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ if $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ \textit{grows} quicker than $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. In other words, can the elements of $(b_n)_n$ eventually \textit{catch-up} $(a_n)_n$?

To understand this idea, consider the series $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty = \{n^2 \vert n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty = \{\texttt{fibo}(n) \vert n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, where $\texttt{fibo(n)}$ is a function that returns the $n$-th element of the Fibonacci sequence (figure \ref{fig:growth-1}). Note that for $n \leq 12$, $b_n < a_n$. However, at $n\geq 13$, $b_n \geq a_n$. Although $(b_n)_n$ starts below $(a_n)_n$, it eventually reaches it and becomes bigger.


\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.5}{\input{figures/growth-1.tikz}}
	\caption{Plot of two series}
	\label{fig:growth-1}
\end{figure*}

Taking a closer look at our example, we can see that the \textit{relative difference} between $a_n$ and $b_n$ (defined as $a_n / b_n$) reaches a peak at $n=4$ (see figure \ref{fig:relative-growth}).

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.5}{\input{figures/relative-growth.tikz}}
	\caption{Relative difference of the series $(a_n)_n$ and $(b_n)_n$}
	\label{fig:relative-growth}
\end{figure*}

At its maximum value, $a_n$ is around 5 times bigger than $b_n$: the relative difference between $a_n$ and $b_n$ is bounded above ($a_n$ is never greater than 5 times $b_n$). If we multiply each entry of $b_n$ by the maximum relative difference, then every element in $(b_n)_n$ will always be greater than or equal to $(a_n)_n$ (see figure \ref{fig:growth-2}). In other words, a series $(a_n)_n$ can never catch $(b_n)_n$ if their maximum relative distance is finite, which means that there will exist some constant $C$ such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $a_n \leq C \cdot b_n$.

A given sequence $(a_n)_n$, however, need not be monotonically increasing. Nevertheless, we can make use of the intuition gained in the previous example to formally define an ordering between two series $(a_n)_n$ and $(b_n)_n$.

To define this ordering, we will make use of the symbol $\prec$ and say that a series $(a_n)_n$ has lower rank than $(b_n)_n$ if their maximum relative distance is bounded above. As we have seen, this implies that there will exist some constant $C$ on the positive real numbers such that every element in $(a_n)_n$ will be less than or equal to $(C b_n)_n$. More formally,


\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.5}{\input{figures/growth-2.tikz}}
	\caption{Plot of two series on the real line. In this example, we multiply the series of fibonacci numbers by a constant that makes every element in the series to be greater than or equal to every element of the series $n^2$.}
	\label{fig:growth-2}
\end{figure*}


\begin{definition}
	Let $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be sequences of positive real numbers. We say that $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty \prec (b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. If there exists $C\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}. a_n \leq C\cdot b_n$
\end{definition}

\subsection*{Belief Propagation}
\subsubsection*{Inference and graphical models}
The computation of marginal probabilities of graphical models is known as inference. The Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm is used to efficiently make inference over graphical models.

Three main kinds of graphical models are Bayesian Networks, pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF), and Factor Graphs. Each of these represent the joint probability of a set of random variables in different graphical ways. There are different methods to perform inference over each of these graphs, but they are all variants of the BP algorithm.


Bayesian Networks are directed graphs for modeling conditional relationships by assuming that the joint distribution of a set of random variables can be described as

\begin{equation*}
	p(x_1, \ldots, x_N) = \prod_{n=1}^Np(x_n\vert \text{Pa}(x_n))
\end{equation*}

where $\text{Pa}(x_n)$ denote the set of nodes that have a \textit{causal} effect on $x_n$.

Pairwise Markov Random Fields, on the other hand, are undirected graphs with an application for computer vision problems. Their joint distribution can be described as a function of neighboring unobserved nodes and pairs of observed and unobserved nodes.

\begin{equation*}
	p({\bf x}, {\bf y}) = \frac{1}{Z}\prod_{n,m}\psi_{nm}(x_n, x_m)\prod_{n}\phi(x_n, y_n)
\end{equation*}

Finally, Tanner Graphs have their origins in an application for decoding of error-correcting codes. Their graphical representation is known as a Factor Graphs with joint probability defined as

\begin{equation*}
	p({\bf x}) = \frac{1}{Z}\prod_{m=1}^M \psi_m(x_m)
\end{equation*}

All three graphical models are equivalent. That is, one can represent a pairwise MRF or Bayesian network into equivalent factor graphs or vice-versa.

The Belief Propagation has different variants depending on the type of graph one choses to work with. Therefore, by deriving the BP algorithm on a pairwise MRF one can generalize the results to the other types of graphical models.

\subsubsection*{Standard Belief Propagation}
The main idea behind the Belief Propagation algorithm for pairwise MRFs is the introduction of messages from one node to the other to efficiently make inference on an unobserved node $x_n$, which results in obtaining the ``belief'' of the node $x_n$, denoted as $b_n(x_n)$.

These ``messages'' introduced by the BP model ameliorate the need to compute in exponential time the marginal probability of a node $x_n$:

\begin{equation*}
	p(x_n) = \sum_{x_m \vert m \neq n} p(x_m),
\end{equation*}

but insted compute this value in terms of the neighboring nodes of $x_n$:

\begin{equation*}
	p(x_n) \propto \phi_n(x_n, y_n) \prod_{j \in N(x_n)} m_{j,n}(x_n)
\end{equation*}

The messages in the BP algorithm are computed recursively until all messages are known. This is done by computing a message as

\begin{equation*}
	m_{ij}(x_j) \leftarrow \sum_{x_i} \phi(x_i) \psi_{ij}(x_i, x_j) \prod_{k \in N(i) \backslash j} m_{ki}(x_i)
\end{equation*}

In practice, one starts by computing the messages at the edges of the graph and propagate the messages if necessary.
